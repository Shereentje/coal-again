        <p>Lany was one of my first concerts I ever went to. My older sister, Sharnila discovered this band and shared
            their music with me. Together like the little fangirls we are, had been to their concert a total of four
            times. The last concert was in 2018. Paul Klein, the singer, had a relationship with no other dan Dua Lipa,
            a famous singer. Apparently Dua was in the audience at the Paradiso. But my sister and I didn’t realize it
            at all, until we went back home and in the train we saw on social media that she was there… Fast forward to
            May 2022, when we went to the concert of Dua Lipa. So we saw here after all. And no, Paul Klein was not in
            the audience, their relationship was already over.</p>
